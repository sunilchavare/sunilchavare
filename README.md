# Hi there, I'm Sunil 👋 
I’m starting my journey as a backend developer, currently learning JavaScript and Node.js by building real projects and contributing to open source.

Right now, my focus is on:
- Writing clean, understandable backend code
- Learning how real systems work (APIs, async code, tooling)
- Becoming a consistent open-source contributor
- Preparing for Google Summer of Code 2026

I believe in learning by doing, so this GitHub will track my progress from beginner to professional — projects, experiments, mistakes, and improvements included.

Long term, I want to work with remote-first teams, build reliable backend systems, and eventually create my own products as a founder.

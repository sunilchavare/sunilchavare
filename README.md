# Hi there, I'm Sunil 👋 

### ⚙️ Backend Product Engineer | Aspiring Founder
I am a Backend Developer starting from scratch in 2026. I specialize in building the "brains" of applications—focusing on scalable architecture, secure APIs, and high-performance server-side logic. My current mission is to secure a spot in **GSoC 2026** and master the infrastructure required for world-class startups.

### 💡 The Backend Philosophy
"Complexity is the enemy of reliability. I build systems that are clean, secure, and built to scale."

### 💡 The Mindset
"Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment. Building 1% better every day."

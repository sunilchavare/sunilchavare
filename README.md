# Hi, I’m Sunil Chavare 👋
### MERN Learner | Software Application Developer

I'm learning software development with a focus on strong fundamentals.

### 🔧 Development
- JavaScript & Node.js (backend-first full stack)
- Building projects and pushing code regularly

### 🧠 Problem Solving
- Data Structures & Algorithms in Python
- Practicing consistently on coding platforms

### 🎯 Current Focus
- Finishing real projects
- Improving code quality and clarity
- Learning how real systems work end-to-end
  
-I believe in learning by doing, so this GitHub will track my progress from beginner to professional — projects, experiments, mistakes, and improvements included.
- Long term, I want to work with remote-first teams, build reliable full-stack systems, and eventually create my own products as a founder.

This profile is a work in progress.
